# Pawly

### Description

Pawly is a website that helps you connect with dog owners in your area in order to set up playdates for their furry frens. You can sign up your pups with your email or gmail account. Add all your pup's info : name, breed, birthday, picture, energy level and a short bio in order to showcase your dog properly. You can then start swiping and choose some nice frens for your pup. When you match with a pup in your area, you are then able to chat directly to set up a playdate.

This website was a collaborative effort done as our final for Lighthouse Labs.
